ðŸ”¹ Introduction

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, and early detection is critical to prevent severe health complications. With the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, healthcare can benefit from predictive systems that analyze medical data and provide reliable insights. This project, GlucoCare, aims to develop a machine learningâ€“based web application for predicting diabetes risk and offering lifestyle suggestions. The system combines multiple ML algorithms, evaluates their performance, and integrates the most accurate model into a user-friendly web interface for real-time prediction.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

Early detection of diabetes remains a challenge, especially in resource-limited settings where regular medical checkups are not always possible. Traditional diagnosis methods may be time-consuming, expensive, and inaccessible to all. There is a need for a low-cost, efficient, and accessible solution that can predict diabetes risk using readily available health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives

To analyze and preprocess the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset for building predictive models.

To train and compare multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).

To select the best-performing model based on precision and overall accuracy.

To design and develop a Flask-based web application with a user-friendly interface.

To deploy the model on Heroku for public access.

To provide lifestyle suggestions along with predictions to support preventive healthcare.

To store user information and prediction history in a database for analysis and reporting.

ðŸ”¹ Applications of the Project

Healthcare Assistance: Helps doctors and healthcare professionals with quick diabetes risk predictions.

Preventive Health: Encourages individuals to monitor health parameters and adopt healthy lifestyles.

Awareness Tool: Provides easy-to-use digital support for patients in rural or remote areas.

Educational Resource: Demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in healthcare systems.

Future Scope: Can be extended to include mobile apps, real-time monitoring, and integration with wearable devices.
