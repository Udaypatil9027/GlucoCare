🩺 Diabetes Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning–based application that predicts whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic using medical and lifestyle parameters. Early detection of diabetes helps in preventing severe health complications and supports better medical decision-making.

This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms trained on historical medical data to provide accurate predictions based on user inputs.

🎯 Objectives
Predict diabetes at an early stage using machine learning
Reduce dependency on time-consuming medical tests
Provide a fast, reliable, and cost-effective prediction system
Demonstrate the application of ML in healthcare

🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

(Best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and evaluation metrics.)
